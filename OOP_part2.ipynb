    "## Object Orient Programming (OOP) continued\n",

    "Continuing the discussion on OOP. At this point, we learned the components of a Class in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is made up of attributes and methods. Attributes describe an object while methods are actions which objects can take. In this example let's get a bit more interactive with the class. Our last example of a class , allowed the user to create a car with make, model, year and color. We added two very static methods - drive and stop. The methods did not do much more than display the status of the oject (car). T\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a more in depth problem and work through creating a class to create circles. We will begin by declaring a class and adding the attributes of the circle.\n",
    "For our circle, there is going to be only one attribute needed and that is the radius. The radius of a circle is a line from the center of the circle to it's perimeter. We can use the radius to solve for several other dimensions of a circle. \n",
    "1.  Diameter - The diameter of a cicle is simply a line from perimeter, through the center and extended to the perimeter. the formula to calculate the diameter of a circle is 2 * radius. \n",
    "2. Area - the area of the circle is simply the area enclosed by the perimeter of a circle. The formula for area is $\\pi$r<sup>2</sup>\n",
    "3. Circumference - The circumference of a circle is the measurement of the perimeter of the circle 2*$\\pi$8*r sometimes expressed as 2$\\pi$r\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know how to calculate it let's create a class with some attribute and methods.  We begin by declaring a class named Circle. Notice we use the capital \"C\" in Circle? This isn't a hard rule, but it is good form to capitalize the first letter of a class. Once we declare the class, our next step is to define our constructor with the attributes. In Python we use __init__() as the constructor. The constructor is the function which will build our object and assign its attributes. \n"

    "To define the remaining 2 methods (area and circumference) we will need to be able to have a constant for pi. We can define a varaible called pi in our script and jsut set it equiavlent to 3.14. This would normally be close enough, but in this class, we will use pi imported from the math package.  We will use an import statement to provide access to pi. When importing a package for ue in a class, we import the package prior to defining our class. For the purpose of demonstration, we will re-declare the class Circle again, but import math beforehand. Our code to this point looks like this with the added import and the definition of our methods"
