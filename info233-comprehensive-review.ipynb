    "\n",
    "* Int - this is an integer. It starts at 0 and can only be a whole number.\n",
    "* Float - these are decimals\n",
    "* String - Typically this is text. The text can be alpha numeric but it is treated as text. You cannot apply math rules to it and they are always surrounded by single or double quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mutability \n",
    "Mutablilty is simply if something can be changed. Something is said to be either mutable or immutable As we learn later, a list is mutable, a tuple is not. \n",

    "* We can also use a \\ character to denote a literal meaning to literally do something. \n",

To start from the front of the string use [0],[1],[2].... to start at the end of the string use [-1],[-2],[-3]... To get the 23rd letter of the alpahbet from a string we can either use mystring[24] or mystring[-3]\n",

    "#### Object Oriented Programming - OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Oriented programming is a programming technique which allows developers to build reusable code.  A few new terms to get us started.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use OOP to create representations of real objects with code.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an object?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objects** - we are surrounded by objects in real life. Everything we see is pretty much an object. For example, a person is an object and we can describe a person with attributes which all people have. A person's name and race, A person's height and weight.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Class** - In programming we can create and object by using a class. A class is a blueprint for creating objects. Picture a cookie cutter that can cut out a certain type of cookie, A cookie's size, shape etc... We can use the cookie cutter to continue to stamp out as many cookies as we want. We do the same when using a class. once we define a class, we can use it as many times as we want to create as many of the objects the class defines as we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Attributes** - Attributes are simply the description of an object. What makes up the object? We will look at a Class which defines cars in lecture. With a car, the attributes may be make, model, year and color. These are items we can use to describe every car we create.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods** – Methods will be used to represent actions. In our example, the methods for a car may be to drive and stop. These are actions which all cars can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quickly review, we will create a Class to create specific object(s) (think of it as a blueprint, or cookie cutter). Within the class we will define attributes for object which describe the object and finally we will create some methods which represents what the object can do.  \n",

    "### API - Applciation Programming Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "An API is a layer of code which acts like a bridge to allow systems to talk to each other. In our case we want to talk to a source of data by using python, we need to use something in common or a pathway to get from our Python code to the data source. What is in common is the data source is on the Internet and we have access to the Internet via Python. An API can take advantage of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style to access data and functions of a particular data source or website. The data and function are represented as resources. REST accesses resources through Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). A common language spoken on the Internet is HTTP and REST can use it as well.  An API is considered RESTful, if it adheres to the guiding principles of REST. We refer to APIs as RESTFUL if we can use it to access a data source via HTTP.\n",

    "So now we have a way to access a data source on the Internet via HTTP Verbs (REST), we just need to enable Python to be able to communicate via HTTP.  We only need to import one library in python, called “requests”\n",

    "In this example, we will use a small API from open-notify.org to retrieve a list of names of astronauts and their spaceships currently in space using requests to setup a conversation between open notify’s API and our code. The API is located at http://api.open-notify.org\n",

    "If you access the API via a browser, you will see the returned data. This is because the browser also uses HTTP verbs to communicate. Specifically, we will use GET to retrieve our data.  Our first step is to make sure the API is functioning correctly. Usually when we query an API, there is the ability to return a message, either an HTTP code 200 which indicates a successful connection or the API may have a built-in message indicating success. Accessing the URL from a browser returns the data below. This data is formatted (although not pleasing to the eye) in a standard called JSON. (JavaScript Object Notation)\n",
