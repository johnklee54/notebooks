    "##### Data Types\n",
    "Python has several different data types. The three we worked with are int, float, string. We also talked about bool.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Int - this is an integer. It starts at 0 and can only be a whole number.\n",
    "* Float - these are decimals\n",
    "* String - Typically this is text. The text can be alpha numeric but it is treated as text. You cannot apply math rules to it and they are always surrounded by single or double quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mutability \n",
    "Mutablilty is simply if something can be changed. Something is said to be either mutable or immutable As we learn later, a list is mutable, a tuple is not. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables \n",
    "* Variables are placeholders in Python. the point to a value  We can assign a variable to reference a value simply by putting an equal (=) sign next to a avariable name and adding a value to the right of the =\n",
    "* Choose smart names - it makes it easier to understand what the variable represents later if the name is somewhat descriptive. \n",
    "* Certain words cannot be used and are reserved key words\n",

    "\n",
    "* Strings are Immutable.\n",
    "* Strings are always encapsulated by quotes, either single (') or double (\"). Of course the larges string we use are enclosed in (\"\"\") triple quotes, as you have seen in our homework assignments. \n",
    "* We can also use the len() to retrieve the length of a string. Helpful later to set up iterations. \n",
    "* We can also use a \\ character to denote a literal meaning to literally do something. \n",

    "* Direct assignment to a variable. \n",

To start from the front of the string use [0],[1],[2].... to start at the end of the string use [-1],[-2],[-3]... To get the 23rd letter of the alpahbet from a string we can either use mystring[24] or mystring[-3]\n",

    "\n",
    "* Strings can come in any combination of case, all upper, all lower or something in between. Python provides a few methods (built-in) functions to convert strings to specific cases. As we discussed, the ability to convert a string to a specific case will be useful especially when testing for conditions.\n",
