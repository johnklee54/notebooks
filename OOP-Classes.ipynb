    "## Object Oriented Programming - OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Oriented programming is a programming technique which allows developers to build reusable code.  We can use OOP to create representations of real objects with code. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need a few new terms to get us started.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is an object?**\n",
    "**Objects** - we are surrounded by objects in real life. Everything we see is pretty much an object. For example, a person is an object and we can describe a person with attributes which all people have. A person's name and race, A person's height and weight.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Class** - In programming we can create and object by using a class. A class is a blueprint for creating objects. Picture a cookie cutter that can cut out a certain type of cookie, A cookie's size, shape etc... We can use the cookie cutter to continue to stamp out as many cookies as we want. We do the same when using a class. once we define a class, we can use it as many times as we want to create as many of the objects the class defines as we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Attributes** - Attributes are simply the description of an object. What makes up the object? We will look at a Class which defines cars in lecture. With a car, the attributes may be make, model, year and color. These are items we can use to describe every car we create. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods** â€“ Methods will be used to represent actions. In our example, the methods for a car may be to drive and stop. These are actions which all cars can perform. \n",
    "\n",
    "To quickly review, we will create a **Class** to create specific object(s) (think of it as a blueprint, or cookie cutter). Within the class we will define **attributes** for object which describe the object and finally we will create **methods** which represent what the object can do.  \n",
    "\n"

    "Lets begin with understanding how classes are defined in Python. There are two ways to define a class in Python\n",
    "1. define the class in the main program\n",
    "2. define the class in a separate file and import it to the main program\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the second way in this example. By defining a class in a separate file, we are able to reuse this class any time we need it. This is one of the great things about using classes, the ability to reuse code. Why reinvent the wheel each time we need a wheel?\n",
    "\n",
    "So lets take a look. I recommend you launch your Python development and create the files as we go. "
